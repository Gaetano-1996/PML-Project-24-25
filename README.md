## Exercise B

There are 3 notebooks covering exercise B:

* fitting_MAP.final.ipynb
* fitting_MCMC_final.ipynb
* learning.final.ipynb

In fitting_MAP.final.ipynb we use gradient descent to find the hyperparameters of the kernel. In one of the last cells we output an array of test log-likelihood values.

All the code for using MCMC/NUTS to compute hyperparameters are in fitting_MCMC_final.ipynb.

The test log-likelihoods outputed in one of the last cells in fitting_MAP.final.ipynb needs to be pasted into fitting_MCMC_final.ipynb so we can create the boxplot comparing the two method.

fitting_MAP.final.ipynb also outputs kernel parameters. These are needed in one of the first cells in learning.final.ipynb for the integral constraint part.
